# Simplified_Website

For my website, I emulated a simplified version of YouTube.
For Bootstrap, each section of code (navbar, hero section, upload form, and table section)
Right now, each JavaScript function calls the alert function. However, I would like each function to do what they say they do.
I.e. the search function goes through every video uploaded for relevent content, the playVideo function would play the selected video.
